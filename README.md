google-form-auto-reply
===================

Some simple google script I created for my organization to do some autoreply to applicants.

Including:
* Instant reply with pre-configured information.

* Automatically addressing the applicant by name.

* Checking if the email addresses provided by the applicant match. If no, automatically send a notification email to organization account, so that we can manually contact the applicant later.

The pdf file is an example of the Google Form we used to record responses. The rows and columns match their corresponding numbers in the .gs file. (Sorry for the format and all that. I'm just new to Github and this is just mostly a personal stuff)
